## Women's AFL

```{r}
library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

players <- read_csv("players.csv")
teams <- read_csv("teams.csv")

ggplot(players,
 aes(x = Kicks, y = Goals,
 colour = Club)) +
 geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
 facet_wrap(~Year, ncol=2)
```

In this exercise, we have learnt the importance of analysing data in all sports, including Women's AFL, which can be used to compare players' strengths and determine award recipients, as well as developing our coding and computing skills, by exploring the R program.
